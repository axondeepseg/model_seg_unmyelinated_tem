# comparative measurements
The scripts in this section are used to compare manual measurements (myelin thickness, axon diameter, g-ratio) taken by an expert with the output of our automatic method. We exclude from this comparison all axons that were not manually measured, so we are comparing paired measurements. To use these scripts, please use an `AxonDeepSeg` virtual environment.
